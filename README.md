# Project Goal
This project asks students to select a passage of approximately 100 words from a text of any genre and examine the
morphology and the word- and sentence-level syntax of the contents. In addition to identifying and quantifying
morphological and syntactic features, students should make an analytical argument about the relationship between the features and the genre and intended audience of the text.
